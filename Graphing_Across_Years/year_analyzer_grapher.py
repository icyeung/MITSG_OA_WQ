# trial 1- let's have each type of data separated from each other
# how should this work

# PCO2
# get one file of pco2 processed data for each year
# input each year as a series
# plot temperature and co2
# potential issues: need to figure out how to make the x axis equal, graph on same y axis scale

# pH
# get one file of pH processed data for each year
# input each year as a series
# plot temperature and pH
# potential issues: need to figure out how to make the x axis equal, graoh on same y axis scale

# conductivity
# separate the locations
# graph the overlaps of the data we have with the buzzard's bay data
# - to do this: need to compare dates, if same, adds data to dataframe
# should use salinity? (check values of salinity because they look weird:/)
# indicates the places where there are castaway meaasurements (dot plot)
# potential issues: need to figure out how to make x axis equal, need to make the data line up and account for breaks, need to ensure overlap program works, 
# graph on same y-axis scale



# trial 2- let's mush everything together and have toggle options on what to display and what not to
# will most likely look too squished to be of any real help
# toggle option will be important
# how the hell do i fit everything on same scale axes
# having date parameters will also be good?
